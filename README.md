# Spam Email Classification Project  
**Developed by Rubab Fatima**  
**Created: November 2023 | Last Updated: April 2025**

## Project Overview  

This project is a machine learning pipeline designed to classify emails as either spam or not spam. It was built as part of my personal project and as well for university project and it shows my skills in Python, data science and machine learning workflows. The project explores different algorithms and techniques for text classification and model evaluation.

## Key Features  

- Multiple machine learning models including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN and Logistic Regression  
- Text preprocessing with NLTK, TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words approaches  
- Performance evaluation through accuracy, training time and confusion matrices  
- Visualizations such as bar charts, heatmaps and ROC curves  
- A simple interface to test custom email samples against trained models  

## Version History  

### v1 (Basic)  
- Initial setup using Linear Regression (converted to a binary classifier)  
- Applied TF-IDF for vectorizing email text  
- Measured accuracy and confusion matrices  

### v2 (Enhanced)  
- Added Logistic Regression and GaussianNB models  
- Improved visualizations with side-by-side comparison charts and ROC curves  

### v3 (Optimized Structure)  
- Refactored into a modular codebase with separate folders for models and utilities  
- Introduced a central configuration file  
- Cleaner evaluation pipeline for comparing multiple models  

### v4 (Feature Engineering)  
- Added handcrafted features such as email text length, special character count and number of capitalized words  
- Performed root node analysis on Decision Trees for interpretability  

### v5 (NLP Upgrade)  
- Integrated advanced text preprocessing using NLTK  
- Included stopword removal, stemming and tokenization  
- Achieved a good balance between accuracy and model interpretability  

## Technical Stack  

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **ML Models:** Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression  
- **Text Vectorization:** TF-IDF, CountVectorizer  

## How to Use  

1. Mount your Google Drive (if using Colab)  
2. Install required dependencies using the requirements file  
3. Run the main script for any version (v3 to v5)

## Why I Built This  

This project was an opportunity to practice building an end-to-end machine learning workflow, starting from raw text data to final model evaluation. It also allowed me to explore different approaches for handling text data, working with imbalanced datasets and comparing model performance trade-offs.

Along the way, I focused on writing clean, modular and production-ready code, along with meaningful visualizations to communicate results effectively.

## For Potential Employers  

This project reflects my ability to:

- Build clean and organized machine learning codebases  
- Document, version and structure projects professionally  
- Balance trade-offs between speed, accuracy and interpretability  
- Communicate technical results through clear visuals and concise explanations
